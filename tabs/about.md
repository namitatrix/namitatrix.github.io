Hello, I am Namita (pronounded Nuh-Mee-Taa)! I am a student in the MA Biostatistics program at University of California, Berkeley. I am also currently collaboraing on a project with [Dr. Elizabeth Purdom](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~epurdom/index.html) in the Department of Statistics at Berkeley, where I wrangle big data sets and apply statistical tools towards the analysis of high dimensional RNA-Seq/Transcriptome data. 

In my first year at Berkeley, I also served as a student instructor for undergraduate probability and statistics courses with applied work in R software. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience of introducing students to the magical world of stats with a special focus on using statistics to solve problems in medicine and public health! 

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a therapeutics discovery researcher in New York City specializing in high-throughput discovery of small molecule compounds and monoclonal antibodies and I was fortunate enough to work on many exciting collaborative projects with physicians and scientists from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weil Cornell Medicine and The Rockefeller University. 

I am passionate about applied statistics in the field of medicine and excited to bring together my interest + experience in biomedical research with my statistics + data science skills in the field of personalized medicine!
